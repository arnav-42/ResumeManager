# ResumeManager
Upload resumes, select one, then click download.

The selected resume will download as your_name_resume.pdf (or whatever you set in config)

It will automatically delete the previous resume from your downloads folder, so you don't need to worry about the pesky "(1)"s and "(2)"s that can show up.
